            <p>We start with the question, What is Music? Well, Music is all around us and everyone has listened to it at least once. Music can be used in different ways so we ask the question, What is Music to you? Could it be your culture? Could it be your therapy? Or could it be your job? Its different for everyone.</p>

            <p>We use, listen, or make Music so much that it can be used for multiple purposes. We never seem to understand how much we use music until you look into it. But What is Music? Where did it originate? Why do people listen to it so much? Those are some questions everyone has asked at least once and they will be answered on our site.</p>
